## A JavaScript Calculator
A simple JavaScript Calculator using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
### Description
Although I have looked into the code of other similar projects for inspiration, I try to be as unique in my implementation and not to copycat anything.
### Build with:
I have used VS Code and Brackets for a code editor.
### Contributions
Please feel free to fork this repo. Since I try to be as unique as possible, I might not merge any pull request unless it is a serious bug.
### Credits
I have taken inspiration from a lot of similar projects. So, thank you eveyone who have ever built a JavaScript Calculator.
